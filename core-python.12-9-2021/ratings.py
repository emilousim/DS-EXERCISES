# the first step we take is importing the file into this file by using the code in line 3. we use the open function to
# open and read the content. second step = (d={}), this creates an empty dictionary to put our key/value pairs in.
# .rstrip takes the \n off and .split slices everything into their key and value pair. once that's done, we just use the
# sorted function which sorts by key, alphabetically.
