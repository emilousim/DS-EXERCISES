<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this exercise you will get additional practice with defining an appropriate

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Define normalization in your own words. Be sure to include why normalization is important.</p></li>

<h2>Part 2: Food Environment Atlas</h2>
<p>For this section, you will need to log in to
<a class="reference external" href="https://data.world/adamhelsinger/food-environment-atlas" target="_blank">data.world</a>
and download the USDA Food Environment Atlas dataset.</p>
<p>One skill of data modeling is taking an existing dataset that is organized in files
and creating a relational model that can be used in a SQL database. In this section,
you will need to carefully review the data in the existing dataset for USDA’s
Food Environment. While the data is organized within files, the existing structure
would not be the perfect data model if you were to seed this data directly into a SQL
database.</p>
<p>After you have reviewed the data in detail, start making a list of tables for your
database. As you consider whenther something should be a table, keep in mind that
it’s helpful for <strong>tables to represent objects or entities</strong>, rather than
ideas or concepts.</p>
<p>After you have a list of tables, make a column list for each table. <strong>You should try to
include all data from the dataset into your data model</strong>. In your colummn list, also
include the datatype for each column.</p>
<p>Lastly, consider the relationships between tables. Do you have a one-to-many relationship
in your data model? Is there a need for any many-to-many relationships? Notate the
relationships using lines between your tables.</p>
<p>Once you have finished your draft, go to  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dbdesigner.net/" target="_blank">DB Designer</a>
and create a final version of your data model.</p>
<p><strong>When you are finished, export your finished database as a PDF and add it to
your repository for this lab exercise. Remember to push to Github!</strong></p>

<section class="section" id="part-3-applied-principles">
<h2>Part 3: Applied Principles</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Imagine you work for the USDA and you are trying to decide how to allocate federal funding
to different states/counties in the United States. <strong>What are some KPIs that may be important
in order to make this decision?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Provide an example of what granularity would look like in the USDA database.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate your data model in terms of normalization. Does your data model fulfill the first normal form?
What about the second normal form? What about the third normal form?</p></li>

<section class="section" id="part-4-covid-19-dataset">
<h2>Part 4: Covid-19 Dataset</h2>
<p>Using the same steps as you used in Part 2, create a revised data model for the
<a class="reference external" href="https://data.world/markmarkoh/coronavirus-data" target="_blank">Daily Coronavirus dataset</a>.</p>
<p>The steps are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Inspect the data carefully.
1. Create a list of tables.
3. Determine the columns for each table.
4. Decide on the relationships between tables, if any.
5. Create a final version of your data model on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dbdesigner.net/" target="_blank">DB Designer</a> .</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to download the final version as a PDF and push to Github.</strong></p>
